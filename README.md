# Jenkins Shared Library: CodeQL Analysis

This [shared library](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) allows Jenkins pipelines to initialize and perform CodeQL analysis on a project. There exists a [Jenkins CodeQL plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/codeql/), but currently it only supports installing and setting up the [CodeQL CLI](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/) on a Jenkins agent during a build.

## Purpose

At a high level, the purpose of this library is to perform the following:

- Download CodeQL
- Detect languages of the project
- Run dynamic CodeQL init step
- if (language == compiled)
  - Trace the build (set environment variables)
- Run commands in plugin block
- Run finalize and analyze commands on all databases
- Upload results to the project repository
- Track timing/overhead of each step
